Project Description:  
This is a group project for the Michigan State University Data Science Capstone course, CMSE 495. The authors of this project are supporting initial research for Documenters, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making government more honest and accessible by publishing public records. The team is tasked with collecting public data on elected officials such as their campaign's financial history, social media, employment history, and affiliations. After collecting the data, the team is expected to create a search engine that returns dossiers of the information for use by journalists and civillians.  

Installation:

The data itself is stored via a public Google Sheets file, but you are welcome to view an example of our data via the ```contact.csv``` file in the GitHub repository. If you would like to view the raw, working dataset, please find the Google Sheets link in the HTML files (line 39 in ```index.html```, and line 23 in ```about.html```) and copy and paste it into your preferred browser!
