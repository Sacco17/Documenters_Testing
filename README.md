Project Description:  
This is a group project for the Michigan State University Data Science Capstone course, CMSE 495. The authors of this project are sponsored by Documenters, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making government more honest and accessible by publishing public records. The team is tasked with collecting public data on elected officials such as their campaign's financial history, social media, employment history, and affiliations. After collecting the data, the team is expected to create a search engine that returns dossiers of the information for use by journalists and civillians.  

The team plans to train an already existing AI webscraper to search for public information, then summarize and visualize the data in a pleasing way.
